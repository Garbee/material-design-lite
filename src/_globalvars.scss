// Our accent is dark, so use $color-dark-contrast for overlaid text.

// Define whether individual color palette items should have classes created.
// Setting this to false will create individual color classes for each color in the palettes.
// To improve overall performance (assuming they aren't used) by:
// * Saving server bandwidth sending the extra classes
// * Save client computation against the classes
// it is RECOMMENDED you keep this at true.

/* ==========  TYPOGRAPHY  ========== */

/* We're splitting fonts into "preferred" and "performance" in order to optimize
   page loading. For important text, such as the body, we want it to load
   immediately and not wait for the web font load, whereas for other sections,
   such as headers and titles, we're OK with things taking a bit longer to load.
   We do have some optional classes and parameters in the mixins, in case you
   definitely want to make sure you're using the preferred font and don't mind
   the performance hit.
   We should be able to improve on this once CSS Font Loading L3 becomes more
   widely available.

$text-link-color: $color-accent !default;

/* ==========  BREAKPOINTS  ========== */

  Per Responsive Web Design, build for mobile first
  and react to larger devices.
