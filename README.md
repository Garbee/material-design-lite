components in vanilla CSS, JS, and HTML

Material Design Lite (MDL) lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your
static content websites. It doesn't rely on any JavaScript frameworks or
libraries. 

## Use MDL on your site?

**This document is targeted at developers that will contribute to or compile
MDL. If you are looking to use MDL on your website or web app please head to
[getmdl.io](http://getmdl.io).**

## Browser Support

Internet Explorer 10 and 11, Chrome, Opera, Firefox, and Safari are fully supported.

## Getting Started

### Download / Clone

Clone the repo using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/material-design-lite.git
```

Alternatively you can [download](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/archive/master.zip)
this repository.

Windows users, if you have trouble compiling due to line endings then make sure
you configure git to checkout the repository with `lf` (unix) line endings. This
can be achieved by setting `core.eol`.

```
git config core.eol lf
git config core.autocrlf input
git rm --cached -r .
git reset --hard
```

> Remember, the master branch is considered unstable. Do not use this in
production. Use a tagged state of the repository, npm, or bower for stability!

### What's included

In the repo you'll find the following directories and files.

| File/Folder     | Provides                                       |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| CONTRIBUTING.md | MDL contribution guidelines.                   |
| gulpfile.js     | gulp configuration for MDL.                    |
| LICENSE         | Project license information.                   |
| package.json    | npm package information.                       |
| README.md       | Details for quickly understanding the project. |
| src             | Source code for MDL components.                |
| test            | Project test files.                            |

### Build

To get started modifying the components or the docs, first install the necessary
dependencies, from the root of the project:

```bash
npm install && npm install -g gulp
```

> MDL requires NodeJS 0.12.

Next, run the following one-liner to compile the components and the docs and
spawn a local instance of the documentation site:

```bash
gulp all && gulp serve
```

Most changes made to files inside the `src` or the `docs` directory will cause
the page to reload. This page can also be loaded up on physical devices thanks
to BrowserSync.

To build a production version of the components, run:

```bash
gulp
```

This will clean the `dist` folder and rebuild the assets for serving.

## Feature requests

If you find MDL doesn't contain a particular component you think would be
useful, please check the issue tracker in case work has already started on it.
If not, you can request a [new component](https://github.com/Google/material-design-lite/issues/new?title=[Component%20Request]%20{Component}&body=Please%20include:%0A*%20Description%0A*%20Material%20Design%20Spec%20link%0A*%20Use%20Case%28s%29).
Please keep in mind that one of the goals of MDL is to adhere to the Material
Design specs and therefore some requests might not be within the scope of this
project.

## Want to contribute?

If you found a bug, have any questions or want to contribute. Follow our
[guidelines](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
and help improve the Material Design Lite. For more information visit our
[wiki](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/wiki).

## Do you include any features that a framework comes with?

Material Design Lite is focused on delivering a vanilla CSS/JS/HTML library of
components. We are not a framework. If you are building a single-page app and
require features like two-way data-binding, templating, CSS scoping and so
forth, we recommend trying out the excellent
[Polymer](http://polymer-project.org) project.
