/**
  The colored buttons here do slightly defer from the spec.
  It isn't clear how they should be colored for different modes.
  We give some minor opacity to the color by default, increase on
  hover and increase more on active state.
  This provides the same level of color modes the other buttons have.
  Doing this improves consistency and accessiblity.
